Welcome to the Graveyard System page! Before interacting with us, it's best suggest to go over things on here, on our strawpage or on our Patreon. Let's go!

》 First of all, we are a suspected dissociative disorder having individual (simplified wording: We suspected we have a dissociative disorder)

We are fine with giving out our status on getting diagnosed; which we are currently in testing.

[To add here, we are traumagentic and because we are comfortable with this at least being known; we have 20+ in our system]

》 "Can I ask who's fronting?" While this can be 'disrespectful' for some systems, we are comfortable with such depending on the way you ask. Please do ask in a respectful manner and you will most likely not get ignored.

》 "What do I call you when talking about all the alters as a collective?" We don't really have a true name in mind but we have been allowing people to use the name 'Eternal' to address us as a collective.

》 "What pronouns do I use for yall as a collective?" When it comes to as a collective, we prefer genderneutrul pronouns such as They/Them. However, our pronouns in general change depending on the alter fronting.

》 "What are you currently diagnosed with?" We are currently diagnosed with conditions; ADHD, anxiety and depression. Which we are getting treated for such, of course.

》 We are a minor. Our birthday is October 13th. Its kinda funny that many of us love Halloween, huh?

》 We are a mainly English user but some of us know little things in other languages.

》 "How should I come up to you?" Bacially nothing much to say here but it mostly depends on the alter on how effective the interaction is. Just be very mindful and in general treat us like a being. We all are socially awkward in our own little ways btw.

》 We switch between We/Us and I/Me when addressing ourselves.

》 Really important things about certain alters/groups of alters!

1) We have a variety of "emotion feeling" alters. Aka some alters just feel little to no emotions!

2) we have a variety of comfort towards touching; both digitally and irl. We DON'T care if you don't care, respect this boundary!!

3) Some of us have typing quirks, I don't think this needs explanation.

4) Some of us don't really have censors, please tell us when to cut it out! :3
We are a suspected dissociative disorder
